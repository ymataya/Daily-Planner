# Daily Planner

## Description
The daily planner is created for anyone who needs help remembering the things they needed to do for the day. The design was made to look clean, straight-forward, and uses hierarchy well. It should have all the options that the users need without them having to look for it (clean and effortless) and it should be able to tell the users what needs to be done at a glance (hierarchy. The color pastel green was chosen since cooler tones have a calmer feeling. A calmer interface will help the users relax and not feel too overwhelmed with the things they have to do for that day. 

## Technologies

## Usage
 It shows the current time and date along with time blocks for every hour, between 9am to 5pm, of that day. Each reminder can be saved and users are able to see it until it gets manually deleted. The time blocks are also color coded depending on the current time. If it's past the current time, the color would be faded, showing that it had past. If the color is a little brighter and the only one in that specific color, then it's the current time. The future time blocks would be the ones with the brightest color to show that they are coming up soon and users should prepare for those reminders.
